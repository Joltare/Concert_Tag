  Concert Tag is an app for people who love to attend concerts but can also be used by someone who likes to have a record of any 
  events they attend. Concert Tag allows you to use. You can use it for family trips, holidays and people who like to travel a lot.
  With Concert Tag you take a picture with your phone and the open the app write the location and a short note and then use a map to
  pinpoint your location and save all that information. Over time your left with a catalogue of places you have been, events you 
  have attended and things you have experienced all individually listed as well as having a map with all the tags visible for all
  the locations you have visited. Kind of like a map on your wall full of pins put together over the years of your life this app 
  can tell your story.

 The app is simple but functional it opens to a splash screen image with a delay of 1200ms. The splash screen displayed above 
 looks good and gives a good impression that the app is musically influenced it’s a guy wearing headphones, screaming and melting it
 also is the external icon for the app in the picture above and is used within the app, it’s the logo for Concert Tag. 
 Once passed the splashscreen you have the main dashboard displayed here up above. At first its bare but this is where the list of 
 Tags will appear once you start taking them. They will appear one underneath the other in a list which you can scroll down. At the 
 top of the dashboard are two icons the first a compass star is the add button. And the second is a map button. The compass button 
 once pressed will take you to the Tag creation screen also displayed up above. Its pretty simple it has
  three buttons at the bottom left is “Tag Yourself” this button opens a google map which will have a tag icon on the map if you long 
  press the tag you can drag it around the map. Once you select a location for the tag you then  The location you leave the tag will
  be saved once you save use the android back button to exit the map back to the Tag creation screen, don’t worry the map tag location
  will be saved when you save the tag. To the left is the “Post a Pic” button which is self-explanatory.  The button will open the file 
  browser and allow you select a photo to display on the Concert Tag displayed down below. Any picture you take with your phone will
  be available for selection in the browser. Choosing a picture closes that screen back to the Concert Tag creation screen. Along with
  the buttons on this screen is two text boxes the top box is Band Name and the bottom box is to enter a name for the location. 
  So “Band Name” Radiohead and “Location” Paris and maybe selecting a pic of Paris will leave you with the Tag displayed below.

Once you have chosen a picture, a band name and a text location and a geo tag location with the map you can select the center button
which is “save a memory”. Selecting this button brings you back to the dashboard where you will see your new Tag displayed.
You may also notice a cancel button, this will return you to the dashboard at any time but won’t save any changes or selections you
have made.
  The final screen is the one that appears after you click the folded map button on top of the dashboard. Up above is the 
  “Places iv been : ) ” screen. This Screen will show all the pegs from all your Tags in one place so you can see all the places 
  you have been, and all the places you have yet to explore! If your using an emulator for android, pressing control on the keyboard 
  along with moving your acts as a pinch zoom allowing you to easily manipulate the map.

Future Plans

The app is very simple and allows some basic actions. Some of the ideas I would like to try in expanding Concert Tag would be to
allow videos to be played through the app. A small thumbnail displayed alongside your chosen picture that when clicked expands 
into a video player with the usual play, pause, progress bar and full screen icon. You choose the option to add a video along side 
the option to add a pic. Once selected you have a screen with two more options either you pick a video from your gallery like you
would a picture and clicking the generated thumbnail would open the video from your phone, the second option is to choose a valid 
video streaming URL (YouTube, daily motion some other compatible sites) and the app would stream that selected video just like the
locally held file there in the app. The only issue would be this needing a web connection but that’s pretty much every device
now anyway. 
	Another option is to have an audio playback feature. Have the option to add multiple fields and each one would be a option 
  to play an audio file. Again, the options being to add some local links to files stored on the device or stream audio from 
  another online source (sound cloud, YouTube music and another compatible services.
And finally have some buttons on every active tab allowing you to share messages, images, audio links and video links through
many of the options built into the android OS ( Bluetooth, Facebook, messenger, Instagram, snapchat, reddit, discord, viber, 
WhatsApp and telegram) there’s dozens of options.

    Conclusion
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	I enjoy playing around with android studio and trying to make all the components fit together and have gained a lot 
	of experience in putting an app together for the assignment. My final product was nothing like I had planned and 
	I’m personally disappointed with what I had to present some personal issues made things harder than they needed to be. 
	I did a lot of playing around with the YouTube and firebase / firestore api’s and tweaking the ui, when it worked, 
	I enjoyed it. I don’t expect much of a grade from this assignment, but I did definitely learnt a lot and enjoyed it
	at the same time. I plan on doing a lot more work brushing up on my kotlin and android studio skills.

(Use API 26  to run the app in android studio it doesn’t play well with 28.)
